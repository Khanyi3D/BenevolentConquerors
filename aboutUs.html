                    <p>This organization was founded, due to a collective group of
                        mothers who have observed their own sons frustrations and
                        anger, fueled by the injustices around them, that leads to
                        anger, rage and violence.
                        We were concerned that there are not enough positive role
                        models, however we knew a lot of good men, who still held
                        up the principles of provision, protecting their families,
                        communities and country.

                        that we could address immediately, like providing
                        toiletries, you might ask why toiletries. The lack of
                        toothpaste, underwear, soap, deodorant and a face
                        cloth are some of the causes that lead to small criminal
                        acts such as shoplifting, theft and later a more serious
                        crimes and violence.
                        The main purpose of this group is to address the
                        immediate need and then deal with more complex
                        issues such as how to navigate life in this ever
                        changing world.
