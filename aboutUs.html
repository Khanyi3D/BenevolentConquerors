                        <p >This organization was founded, due to a collective group of
                        mothers who have observed their own sons frustrations and
                        anger, fueled by the injustices around them, that leads to
                        anger, rage and violence.
                        We were concerned that there are not enough positive role
                        models, however we knew a lot of good men, who still held
                        up the principles of provision, protecting their families,
                        communities and country.

                        <p>With the help of our sons we identified urgent needs
                            that we could address immediately, like providing
                            toiletries, you might ask why toiletries. The lack of
                            toothpaste, underwear, soap, deodorant and a face
                            cloth are some of the causes that lead to small criminal
                            acts such as shoplifting, theft and later a more serious
                            crimes and violence.
                            The main purpose of this group is to address the
                            immediate need and then deal with more complex
                            issues such as how to navigate life in this ever
                            changing world.</p>
